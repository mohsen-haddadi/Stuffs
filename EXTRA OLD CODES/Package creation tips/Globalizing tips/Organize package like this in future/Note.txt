1. There are 2 ways to create a global scope
   1. simply assign the variable outside functions
   2. global it inside a function but don't remember to run that funtion 
      before using that variable inside or ouside other funcions to resist NameError.

2. using global line in a function is for:
   1. introduce and creating a new global variable or
   2. modify and assigning a global variable

3. Whenever using save_variables() inside a function, make sure you have already used
global line for the global variables you are assigning;
to affect that variable into save_variables().

4. in save_variables() definition there is no need to use global line.
using load_variables() inside save_variables() definition leads to wrong answers. 

5. using save_variables() and load_variables() procedure:
   a: global x
   b: load_variables() 
   c: assign x
   d: save_variables()
   
   (c always needs a)
   (d always needs b. exeption: set_variables_to_None() a <- c <- d )

   non pure:
   1. b <- d  (no usage)
   2. a <- b <- c <- d  

   pure:
   1. a <- b <- c <- return
   2. b <- return
   note: In Poker package i do not use global variables for pure function. 
         so they are real pure, like modules in pixel_matching sub package.

   *look at directory below for example
    (Globalizing tips\globaling variables between modules\Right method. using pickle library)

   *only global the variables which you assing, not the one you read or use, 
    if there is no assiging variables just use load_variables(). 

   *save_variables() function read or use variables, so if a variable is not assigned inside a function
    there is no need to global it in that function to affect it in the save_variables().

   *globaling line in load_variables() works fine to affect all variables into save_variables().
    so while using save_variables() you must use load_variables() at first.
    ( exeption: set_variables_to_None() a <- c <- d )

   *look at directory below for further old example
   ('Globalizing tips\Organize package like this in future\how to use load and save variables functions')

6. pure functions uses return; non pure uses save_variables

7. make all pixel matching, card findings and ocr functions; pure functions by 
using return; and then assign returned values into variables
(ex: card_1th, dealer_seat,....)and save_variables() them,
all in a single function like read_game_variables()

8. modules like: straight, flush, supporting_functions and... uses pickled variables 
and therefore do not need to import other pixel matching modules

9. Only in these modules save_variables() is defined and used:
   1. file_level_1o5th_game_coordinates
   2. file_level_1o6th_game_variables
   3. file_level_2th_buttons ( to save the rasing amount of mine,
      at raise() button function )

10. don't use load_variables() and save_variables() at unnessesary places.
